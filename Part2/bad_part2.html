        FORMULIZE Web Application :</dt>
        </p>
        <dd>
        <li>This project was completed successfully as a requirement of U of A in association with the Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects program (UCOSP). The business partner was Freeform Solutions Company, Toronto Ontario.</li>
        <li>
        Formulize is a web based content management system, that itself is a tool that helps to build data management systems on the web by “power users”. Administrators can develop Forms and attach modeled workflows to deliver a quick application that customizes the interaction of users with data managed by Formulize. Formulize sets on top and relies on MySQL database from Oracle.
        </li>
        <li>
        Scope of work: To develop an end user export and import utility for the Formulize application to facilitate the transfer of applications between different installations of Formulize. The utility should be seamlessly integrated to the main application and to be accessed from within. It is required that the utility to be easy to use by a normal user and only request his input when a business decision is to be made, such as whether to export the forms of the application blank or with data .System was completed successfully using PHP/MYSQL and Javascript .A working version of this feature is available on formulize Github repository.

        Rehabilitation Assistance Application (MS Kinect) :</p></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>
               This application was jointly developed as a requirement of a university course and in collaboration with the “Glenrose Hospital” rehabilitation center. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Scope of work: to develop a computer game actuated by means of the Microsoft Kinect sensor kit and equipment; the computer game will be used to test patient response to a random position projection of balloons on the floor. Patients are requested to reach and touch the balloon projected image, and the Kinect sensor will track patient movement and report path and response time. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We were team of 3 student program; jointly we accomplished all the client interviews and compiled the business requirements. However, my specific role was to develop all the required interfacing programs using c#, and developed the Kinect device calibration program.

        <dd>
            <li>
                This application was jointly developed as a requirement of a university course and in collaboration with the Engineering Department of University of Alberta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scope of work: to develop an end user interface to facilitate the data browsing and provides online analysis and graphing tools. The system was developed using PHP & MySQL database and used Model–view– controller (MVC) software architecture. 
            </li>
            <li>
              We were a team of 6 students; jointly we accomplished all the client interviews and compiled the business requirements. However, the System still needs more development. I have assumed the DBA rule; I have managed the creation of the MySQL database and the data migration. In addition to the usual objects management, I have developed PHP database integration package to facilitate the interface between the viewer & the database, developed many views to facilitate the user reports and calculations a set of complex formulas.

            <li>
                Scope of work: to construct a 3D model of an animated toy and to track and capture its motion and the apply it to the 3D mesh that was scanned earlier.
            </li>
            <li>
                We were a team of 2 Undergrad-student and one Graduate Student, jointly we were able to construct a 3D mesh for the selected toy, capture its animation and apply it to the Mesh.
